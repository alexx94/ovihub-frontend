Elemente UI: (**Posibil sa modific numele din Assign Roles -> Manage Users)
1) Search User by Email
   - For ui a basic search bar with a magnifying glass button next to it
   - Probably will be treated as a form so that 'enter key' works by default, and preventDefault() to not reset the email input
   - On submit, searchUser

   - If user not found:
      Display error message
   - If user is found:
      Render the component that displays the user info, Current Roles, and lastly the Assign New Role dropmenu


-------------
Componentele astea o sa fie toate sub acelasi div:
2) User info block:
   - email, userId, display name, phone number (if exists)

3) Current Roles table:
   - Reuse the same table component used at Manage Roles
   - Here fetch the user's active roles (get user's roles API, or the get UserWithRoles api that includes its roles in the user get response)
   - only change the action button, instead of calling DeleteRoleApi, it should call the RemoveRoleApi (this API removes a role from a user, not the role itself)
   - Make the table scrollable, instead of taking space vertiaclly, for a cleaner look

4) Assign New Role:
   - Display in a dropmenu, the list of all the roles
   - Populate dropmenu with the fetchRoles that is used also across the ManageRoles component (fetchRoles API)
   - The add button is only enabled when a role is selected from dropmenu, and if that role also isnt already in the currentRoles list of roles (the role name)
